# CI/CD-Java-App
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) pipeline is an automated software development practice that helps to improve the quality of software development, increase the speed of the delivery process, and reduce the risk of deployment. The CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that build, test and deploy software changes.

In order to complete this project it is recommended to have a general understanding of AWS, Docker, Jenkins, andÂ Git.
In this project, we will be building CI/CD pipeline for a Java application.
